Structured vs. Unstructured Data?
What’s the Difference?

When it comes to data, files can come in many different forms. There are two main types of data—structured and unstructured. 
Each is sourced and collected in different ways, living on different types of databases, so their differences are important for data professionals.

Widely used structured data :

    · Spreadsheets
    
    · Databases that store datasets

Widely used unstructured data :

    • Audio files
    
    • Video files
    
    • Emails
    
    • Photos
    
    • Social media

 

Unstructured data is every other type of data that is not structured. The unstructured data format can be harder to analyze. 
But, you’ll be working with structured data most of the time. For example, if you need to analyze data about the unstructured 
data in emails, photos, and social media sites, it will most likely be structured for analysis before you even get to it.

 
Structured data is typically quantitative data that is organized and easily searchable. The programming language Structured Query 
Language (SQL) is used in a relational database to “query” to input and search within structured data.

As a quick refresher, structured data is data organized in a format like rows and columns. Structured data works nicely within
a data model, which is a model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another.


What are data elements?
They’re Pieces of information, such as people's names, account numbers, and addresses.

Data models help to keep data consistent and provide a map of how data is organized. This makes it easier for analysts and
other stakeholders to make sense of their data and use it for business purposes.

In addition to working well within data models, structured data is also useful for databases. This makes it easy for analysts 
to enter, query, and analyze the data whenever they need to. This also helps make data visualization pretty easy because structured
data can be applied directly to charts, graphs, pie charts, dashboards, and most other visual representations of data.

Structured vs. unstructured data :
The main difference is that structured data is defined and searchable. This includes data like dates and phone numbers. Unstructured
data is everything else, which is more difficult to categorize or search, like photos, videos, podcasts, social media posts, and emails. 
Most of the data in the world is unstructured data.

Unstructured data tools:

Unstructured data is typically supported by flexible NoSQL-friendly data lakes and non-relational databases. As a result, some of the 
tools you might use to manage unstructured data include

·       MongoDB

·       Hadoop

·       Azure.

Structured data tools:

Structured data is typically stored and used with relational databases and data warehouses supported by SQL. Some examples of tools
used to work with structured data include:


·      OLAP

·      MySQL

·      PostgreSQL

·      Oracle Database

Data-focused professions:

·       Machine learning engineer

·       Database administrator

·       Data architect

·       Data scientist

·       Data engineer

·       Data analyst
